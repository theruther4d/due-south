    <p>I've got a bit of writer's block, so I thought it would be fun to share with you some of my favorite things. That's right...it's time for FRIDAY'S FAVS!! I just imagined myself screaming that in my best Oprah Winfrey while hundreds of people cry like I've changed their lives somehow. AAHH, the power! Moving on - I've been really inspired by moody shades lately. My husband heard that somehow telepathically and gave a big AMEN. I think there is something really beautiful about the restraint you have to have when going dark. I know most of you have heard the myth that you shouldn't paint a small room a dark color. I say pish-posh. Let's get dark.</p><h2>1. Living Room</h2><img class="fluid" src="https://duesouth.imgix.net/2793a42eb8d557403b8ed7c0c89b4c2c0adaee59_living-room.jpg" /><p>The success of this room is clearly the natural light. You can definitely create a dark space without natural light, it will just give you a different feel. This room is open and airy, even with the large pieces of furniture. The color is a great contrast to the stark white of the baseboards, window frames, and crown molding. This eclectic vibe of art, furniture, and decor go perfect with the age of this home. Seriously, the light fixure looks like it was pulled straight out of The Jetsons - I dig it! Lesson #1: explore other colors than just black. This navy picks up on the warm tone of the wood floors and still lets the art pop.</p><h2>2. Bathroom</h2><img class="fluid" src="https://duesouth.imgix.net/efa29f673c2c2aaa14693398dc5cfac226390dbd_bathroom.jpg" /><p>Oh, tiny bathroom - how I hate you so. I used to live in an apartment that had a MASSIVE bathroom and I took it for granted. Now I live in a closet in San Francisco and can basically touch my bed from my shower. I know a lot of people that will disagree with me on this, but I love that they had the guts to get dark in this room. The richness of this green makes me want to live in this bathroom forever. The choice of going with open-shelving instead of a cabinet above the thrown is a great one! It doesn't take up any extra space and it gives you a chance to go out any buy products in pretty packaging that you'll never use. Lesson #2: use greenery everywhere - even in the bathroom! Living things always bring a bit of happiness into any room.</p><h2>3. Office</h2><img class="fluid" src="https://duesouth.imgix.net/8bf42a79d4c5a98d22f2441d1fd6a10f830c3c75_office.jpg" /><p> I could be so productive in this room! Again, the natural light is the winner of this one - notice the overhead light isn't even on and it's so gloriously bright. No napping on the job here. This grey is the closest to black we've seen yet. I appreciate the light tones they are creating with furniture, drapery, and carpet. I might have gone with a darker stain on the desk, but it's still beautiful. Lesson #3: don't be afraid to paint molding. I think the delicate molding painted this deep grey brings a sophistication to this room and gives it a really expensive feel. Ooh-la-la</p><h2>4. Bedroom</h2><img class="fluid" src="https://duesouth.imgix.net/2554eb882db1c3fe769fc55ee50d6a9d79c05ec5_bedroom.jpg" /><p>The bold and the BLACK. This room has got me in love! It might be a bit masculine for most, but I love the things they are doing here. First, these honey floors are glowing in contrast to the walls. And the headboard is so lovely, my eyes are drawn to that first. Also, the choice to not cover these walls with art is a bold, but smart one. Lesson #4: less is more. You don't have to adorn every wall with some piece of art. The minimalistic choices made here are spot-on and the texture brought by the throws adds a level of warmth and comfort to this dark space. </p><p>You may have noticed I didn't share a kitchen example in this post. I personally prefer a bright kitchen. Something about mixing food and fire in a dark room makes me hyperventalate. The point is for you to be comfortable. Find something that moves you - weather dark or light or somewhere in between. </p>
