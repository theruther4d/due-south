That's right...it's time for FRIDAY'S FAVS!! I just imagined myself screaming that in my best Oprah Winfrey while hundreds of people cry like I've changed their lives somehow. AAHH, the power! Moving on - I've been really inspired by moody shades lately. My husband heard that somehow telepathically and gave a big AMEN. I think there is something really beautiful about the restraint you have to have when going dark. I know most of you have heard the myth that you shouldn't paint a small room a dark color. I say pish-posh. Let's get dark.</p><h2>1.

I personally prefer a bright kitchen. Something about mixing food and fire in a dark room makes me hyperventalate. The point is for you to be comfortable. Find something that moves you - weather dark or light or somewhere in between. </p></div>
